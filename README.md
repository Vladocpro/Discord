# Project description

I created a Discord clone using MERN, RESTful API, WebSocket, WebRTC, Redux, and JWT auth. The Discord users are able to send invitations to each other with options to accept or decline the friendship request. It also updates the real-time friends' list and their online status, and enables them to create a room for a maximum of four people. Real-time communication is possible by messaging a friend and viewing the message history with dates, seeing friends' rooms, joining them, and communicating. Users who join somebodyâ€™s room can also share their screen, turn on/off their web camera, and microphone.

# To download all depedencies go to client and server directory:
### `npm install`

# Also you need to create .env file, type in MongoDB collection link and random string for JWT.


# To run client:
### `npm start`

# To run server:
### `npm run devStart`
